**Disclaimer:** this library is **not** endorsed by the company Rademacher, the manufacturer of home automation products
under the label duofern. The name pyduofern was chosen to indicate the function of the library: communicating with
duofern devices via python.

These are my efforts in porting the `FHEM <http://fhem.de/fhem.html>`_
`Duofern USB-Stick <https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/DUOFERN>`_ based module to
`Homeassistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`_. As of now the port is rather ugly, but it is usable enough to control
my Duofern blinds. I did not port the Weather-Station related features of the original module -- Mainly because I
do not own the corresponding hardware and have no means to test if it works. I only tested it with the model
*RolloTron Standard DuoFern 14233011 Funk-Gurtwickler Aufputz*.

As reported in `#31 <https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern/issues/31>`_ 10-Digit codes recently announced by Rademacher are not supported as of now as the handshake/
protocol for these devices was not reverse engineered by anyone as far as I know.

This requires the Duofern USB Stick Art.-Nr.: 70000093 by Rademacher.

I do not provide any guarantees for the usability of this software. Use at your own risk.

Getting Started
===============

Install via::

     pip3 install pyduofern

or if you want the development version from github::

     pip3 install git+https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern.git@dev

udev configuration
==================
to make your usb stick easy to identify deploy an `udev rules <https://wiki.debian.org/udev>`_ file in
``/etc/udev/rules.d/98-duofern.rules`` or the equivalent of your distribution. The following worked for my
stick::

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", SYMLINK+="duofernstick"

Or, if you use several USB-Serial adapters with vendor ``0403`` and product ``6001`` find out the serial number of your
stick (assuming it is currently registered as ``/dev/ttyUSB0```)::

    user@host:~ > udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB0 | grep '{serial}' | head -n1
    ATTRS{serial}=="WR04ZFP4"

As you can se for me the serial is ``WR04ZFP4``. Use the following udev line (use the serial you found above)::

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="WR04ZFP4", SYMLINK+="duofernstick"

Once the rule is deployed your stick should show up as ``/dev/duofernstick`` as soon as you plug it in. This
helps avoid confusion if you use other usb-serial devices. Also be warned: The line also makes the stick
accessible to non-root users. But likely on your system you will be the only user anyhow.

Getting Started
===============
To start using your stick you can use the ``duofern_cli.py`` script which should have been installed together
with the pyduofern module. Begin by choosing a 4 hex-digit system code. If you have already used the roller shutters
with FHEM use the last 4 digits of your FHEM code to preserve pairings. Ideally write it down, if you forget
it, you will likely have to chose a new system code and reset your devices in order to be able to pair them again.
It is also a security feature which is why no default is provided.

Decide for a system configuration file. By default it will reside as a hidden config file in your home directory in
``~/.duofern.json``. Pass the config file to ``duofern_cli.py`` via the command line option ``--configfile``.
The default has the advantage that you do not always have to pass the config file when using the script. Initialize
the config file with your system code with the following command::

   duofern_cli.py --code <your chosen 4 digit hex code here>
   # or if you prefer your own configfile location
   doufern_cli.py --code <your chosen 4 digit hex code here> --configfile <your config file path>

Now RTFM of the shutter to find out how to start pairing. Set the maximum and minimum positions according to the manual.
If you want to experiment with the shutter first, chose the two positions very near each other. The motors shut down
after a certain maximum runtime and you could exceed that while experimenting if you move the shutters up and down
several times unless the min and max positions are close to each other.

Start out by pairing your first rollershutter::

    duofern_cli.py --pair --pairtime 60

now initiate pairing via the buttons on your shutter. Once a shutter is paired it should show up in your
config file and you can name it. Say the blind that popped up has the ID ``408ea2``, run the following to give it
the name ``kitchen``::

    duofern_cli.py --set_name 408ea2 kitchen
    # you can now try to also have it move up or down:
    duofern_cli.py --up kitchen
    # or try to set the position of a blind (0=down, 100=up)
    duofern_cli.py --position 42 kitchen

Hopefully you now have working command line interface that knows how to move up or down your shutters. But the python
interface can do more, (which I was so far too lazy to expose via the command line):

Indexing paired blinds
----------------------
If you have the system code of your system but lost the list of configured blinds you can use the CLI to refresh
the config file with all paired blinds.::

    # assuming you lost the config file
    duofern_cli.py --code <your code> --refresh --refreshtime 60

will start up the stick and listen for connecting blinds for 60 seconds. It will store all the blinds that were found
in the default config file.a

Usage with Homeassistant
========================
There is a custom component for homeassistant that can be easily deployed via hacs at `<https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern-hacs>`_


Usage from python
=================
.. code-block:: python

    from pyduofern.duofern_stick import DuofernStickThreaded
    import time
    stick = DuofernStickThreaded(device="/dev/duofernstick") # by default looks for /dev/duofernstick
    stick._initialize() # do some initialization sequence with the stick
    stick.start() # start the stick in a thread so it keeps communicating with your blinds
    time.sleep(10) # let it settle to be able to talk to your blinds.
    # your code here
    # this uses internal variables of the duofern parser module and likely I will wrap it in
    # the future.

    print(stick.duofern_parser.modules['by_code']['1ff1d3']['position'])

    command("1ff1d3", "up") # open the blind with code 1ff1d3

    stick.command("1ff1d3", "down") # down the blind with code 1ff1d3

    stick.command("1ff1d3", "stop") # stop the blind with code 1ff1d3

    stick.command("1ff1d3", "position", 30) # set position of the blind with code 1ff1d3 to 30%

Look for an indication of possible commands in ``pyduofern/definitions.py``
I just translated them into python and did not explore what might be possible.
It looks like a lot of functionality requires a weather station, but you can just as
easily automate the stuff using your home automation and having it send the up and down
commands instead of buying a weather station.

Changelog
=========
**0.35.1**

- fix issue with crashes when "sets" was not defined because a bogous device type was present in duofern config.

**0.35.0**

- limit message sending frequency.

**0.34.3**

- Fix issue with asynchronous code in synchronous part of the code that was breaking homeassistant.

**0.34.2**

- merged pull request by [@realbuxtehuder](https://github.com/realbuxtehuder) that adds stop command to cli

**0.34.1**

- functionally equivalent to 0.34.0, removed shebangs where not required, moved unit tests outside of packaging

**0.34.0**

- merge callback state updates for covers introduced by @DomiStyle in #21 to master

**0.33.0**

- add smokedetector introduced by @DomiStyle in #20 to master

**0.32.0**

- fix case to try and fix #18 for sensorMsg

**0.30.0**

- **breaking change**: instead of creating multiple devices for single physical devices with multiple actor channels which was rather buggy add a ``channel`` parameter to the respective functions inpyduofern.duofern.Duofern() which allows to handle channels in a consistent manner. See discussion in https://github.com/gluap/pyduofern/pull/9 . For each device available channels are listed in in Duofern().modules['by_code'][code]['channels']. The default channel available for all devices is ``None``, otherwise an ``int`` is expected.
